# six-sigma-project-SPRL
Six Sigma quality control project, aimed at reducing product rejection due to nominal diameter oversize.
## Reduction in Piston Rejection using Six Sigma Methodology

This project was conducted as part of a quality improvement initiative at Shriram Pistons & Rings Ltd. The goal was to reduce piston rejections caused by oversized diameters using Six Sigma techniques.

### Methodology:
- DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)
- Tools: Pareto Chart, Fishbone Diagram, Paired Comparison, Multivariable Search, Regression Analysis

### Outcome:
- Root causes identified as RPM variation and seat sharpness.
- Optimized machine settings proposed to reduce rejection and improve process capability
